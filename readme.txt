Lecture and revision notes for University of West London L6 Computing Module Knowledge Based Systems. Material based on the text book:

Module Text Book: Machine Learning, Tom Mitchell, McGraw Hill, 1997. 

Lecture notes use a personalised (forked!) version of the Rico style from the Prosper package - this is included with these notes.

Some lecture notes also reference images provided by the above book author. You'll need these if you want to build the lecture notes. At the time of writing these were available from here: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/theo-20/www/mlbook/latex-support.html 
* Download the bookps.tar.gz
* Extract to the directory where the lecture notes were extracted
* Run the provided makefile <- requires a working LaTeX installation to build slides.
