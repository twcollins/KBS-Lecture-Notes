\begin{slide}{Artificial Intelligence}
\begin{itemize}
 \item  Somewhat controversial issue historically.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Question:} What is your definition of AI? 
	\end{itemize}
 \item There can be considered four views of what AI is:
	\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{c||c}
	\rowcolor[HTML]{aabbcc}\textbf{Thinking in a } & \textbf{Thinking in a} \\
	\rowcolor[HTML]{aabbcc}\textbf{human manner} & \textbf{rational manner}\\ \hline \hline
	\rowcolor[HTML]{aabbcc}\textbf{Acting in a } & \textbf{Acting in a} \\
	\rowcolor[HTML]{aabbcc}\textbf{human manner} & \textbf{rational manner}\\ 
	\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
 \item In this context we focus on the emergence of rational actions.
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{slide}{Acting humanly: Turing Test}
\begin{itemize}
 \item  Turing (1950) ''Computing machinery and intelligence'':
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Can machines think? $\xrightarrow{}$ Can machines behave intelligently?
	\item Operational test for intelligent behaviour: \textit{The Imitation Game}
	\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{Turing_Test_version_4.eps}
	\end{figure}
	\end{itemize}
\item Suggested major components of AI: knowledge, reasoning, language understanding, learning
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{slide}{Thinking humanly: Cognitive modelling}
\footnotesize 
\begin{itemize}
 \item 1960s ''Cognitive revolution'': information-processing psychology 
 \item Requires scientific theories of internal activities of the brain.
	\begin{itemize}
 	\item  How to validate? Requires: 
		\begin{enumerate}
 		\item Predicting and testing behaviour of human subjects (top-down) \textbf{or}
   		\item Direct identification from neurological data (bottom-up)
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{itemize}
 \item  Both approaches (Cognitive Science and Cognitive Neuroscience) are now distinct from AI. The following characteristic is shared however:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textit{The available theories do not explain anything resembling human-level general intelligence!}
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Thinking rationally: ''Laws of thought''}
\tiny
\begin{itemize}
 \item Prescriptive rather than descriptive.
 \item Aristotle: ''What are correct arguments/thought processes?''
\item Several Greek schools developed various forms of logic: 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Notation and rules of derivation for thoughts;
	\item May or may not have proceeded to the idea of mechanization
	\end{itemize}
\item Direct line through mathematics and philosophy to modern AI
\item Issues:
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Not all intelligent behaviour is mediated by logical deliberation
	\item What is the purpose of thinking? What thoughts should I have?
	\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Acting Rationally}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Acting
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Catch-all term meaning the observed emergent behaviour 
	\end{itemize}
\item Rational
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Maximise benefit at each stage/during each operational condition.
	\end{itemize}
\item Doesn't necessarily involve thinking!
	\begin{itemize}
	\item e.g. blinking reflex 
	\end{itemize}
\item However ‘thinking’ should be in the service of rational action 
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Rational Agents}
\begin{itemize}
 \item An agent is an entity that perceives and acts.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item e.g. a web spider, a dedicated analysis algorithm etc
	\end{itemize}
\item For any given class of environments and tasks, we seek the agent (or class of agents) with the best performance.
\item However domain and computational limitations make perfect rationality unachievable.
\item Agents need to be provided with the capabilities to deal with such limitations.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Machine Learning
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{slide}{Machine Learning}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Discipline that is concerned with the design and development of algorithms that allow computers to learn based on data.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Automatically learn to recognize complex patterns and make intelligent decisions based on data.
	\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Question:} What does intelligent mean in this context?
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}
